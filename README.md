## Abstract

Grocery stores shape the everyday food experience of New Yorkers and offer a view into the city’s cultural and linguistic diversity. Unlike upscale restaurants, they are rooted in local life, making them a powerful lens through which to explore multicultural identity in urban space. This project investigates how grocery store names and signage reflect neighborhood identity and communicate cultural values.

Using data visualization, it maps linguistic and visual patterns across city neighborhoods alongside demographic indicators such as race, age, and income. By analyzing name structures and signage aesthetics—such as color, typography, and language—the study reveals how design choices express identity and reflect the communities they serve. In doing so, the project positions grocery signage not only as functional design, but as a form of cultural storytelling within the evolving landscape of New York City.
